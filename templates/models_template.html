                <p>In HTML 4 there were only two main content models, block and inline level elements. <strong>Block level</strong> elements would stack on top of each other in normal document flow while <bold>inline level</bold> elements typically appear within the flow of text content.</p>
                <p>In this example the <bold>heading 1</bold> and the paragraphs are block level items, while the bold tags and the link below are examples of inline level elements.</p>
                <p>In HTML5 new content models have been created to expand the structure and semantic capabilities of HTML. There are seven main models: <strong>Flow, Metadata, Embedded, Interactive, Heading, Phrasing, and Sectioning.</strong> To learn more about them, visit the <a>interactive graphic</a> contained in the W3C HTML5 specfication.</p>
